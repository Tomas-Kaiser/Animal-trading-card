       Blue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth. These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to <strong>100 feet long</strong> and upwards of <strong>200 tons</strong>.
       Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile.
